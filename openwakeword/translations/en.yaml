configuration:
  model:
    name: Model
    description: >-
      Wake word model to use.
  threshold:
    name: Threshold
    description: >-
      Activation threshold (0-1), where higher means fewer activations.  See
      trigger level for the relationship between activations and wake word
      detections.
  trigger_level:
    name: Trigger level
    description: >-
      Number of activations before a detection is registered. A higher trigger
      level means fewer detections.
  noise_suppression:
    name: Noise suppression
    description: >-
      Enable noise suppression using speexdsp. This should be used for low
      quality microphones, or in noisy environments where noise suppression is
      not available on the voice satellite.
  debug_logging:
    name: Debug logging
    description: >-
      Enable debug logging. Useful for seeing each wake word detection in the logs.
